1. What profiling tools does Visual Studio provides?


Visual Studio provides several profiling tools that can help you analyze the performance of your code. Here are some of the profiling tools provided by Visual Studio:
CPU Usage Profiling: This tool helps you identify the functions and methods that are consuming the most CPU time.
Memory Usage Profiling: This tool helps you identify memory leaks and other memory-related issues in your code.
Performance Profiling: This tool helps you identify performance bottlenecks in your code by measuring the time taken by each function and method.
Code Coverage Profiling: This tool helps you identify the code that is executed during a test run and the code that is not executed.
Thread Profiling: This tool helps you identify thread-related issues in your code, such as deadlocks and race conditions.
GPU Usage Profiling: This tool helps you identify the functions and methods that are consuming the most GPU time.

2. What typical performance issues could you mention? How to diagnose and prevent them?

High CPU usage: This can be caused by inefficient algorithms, excessive looping, or other factors. To diagnose this issue, you can use a CPU profiler to 
identify the functions and methods that are consuming the most CPU time. To prevent this issue, you can optimize your algorithms, reduce the number of loops, 
and use caching and other techniques to improve performance.

Memory leaks: This occurs when memory is allocated but not released, leading to a gradual increase in memory usage over time. To diagnose this issue, 
you can use a memory profiler to identify the objects and methods that are consuming the most memory. To prevent this issue, you can ensure that all 
memory is properly allocated and released, use garbage collection, and avoid circular references.

Slow database queries: This can be caused by inefficient database design, poorly optimized queries, or other factors. To diagnose this issue, 
you can use a database profiler to identify the queries that are taking the most time. To prevent this issue, you can optimize your database design, 
use indexes and other optimization techniques, and avoid unnecessary queries.

3. What .pdb files are and how are they used in debugging?

A .pdb file is a file generated by the compiler that contains debugging information about an executable or a DLL. This file contains information about the symbols, 
functions, and variables in the code, as well as the source file and line numbers where they are defined.
When you debug an application, the debugger uses the .pdb file to map the machine code back to the original source code. 
This allows you to set breakpoints, step through the code, and inspect variables and memory locations.

4.What “Unmanaged resources” in .NET are?

In .NET, unmanaged resources are resources that are not managed by the .NET runtime, such as file handles, database connections, and network sockets. 
These resources are typically allocated by the operating system or other external systems and must be explicitly released by the application when they are no longer needed.

5. How do you understand Dispose pattern? How is it related to destructors?


The Dispose pattern is a design pattern used in .NET to ensure that unmanaged resources are properly released when they are no longer needed. 
The pattern involves implementing the IDisposable interface and providing a Dispose method that releases the unmanaged resources.
The Dispose method can be called explicitly by the application, or it can be called automatically by the using statement. 
The using statement ensures that the Dispose method is called even if an exception is thrown, which helps to prevent resource leaks.
The Dispose pattern is related to destructors (Finalize method in C#), which are used to release unmanaged resources when an object is garbage collected.
However, destructors are not guaranteed to be called immediately, and they can cause performance issues if they are used to release large or complex resources.
To avoid these issues, the Dispose pattern is preferred over destructors for releasing unmanaged resources. The Dispose method can be called explicitly to release 
the resources immediately, and it can also be called by the finalizer to ensure that the resources are released if the application fails to call Dispose.

6. How can you debug compiled applications?

Debugging symbols: Debugging symbols are files that contain information about the code, such as function names, variable names, and line numbers. 
These symbols can be generated by the compiler and linked to the executable or DLL. Debugging symbols can be used by a debugger to map the machine code back to the original source code.
Debugging symbols are generated by default when you build your code in debug mode.

Visual Studio debugger: Visual Studio provides a powerful debugger that can be used to debug compiled C# applications. You can attach the debugger to the running process
or start the application in debug mode. The debugger allows you to set breakpoints, step through the code, and inspect variables and memory locations.

Debugging tools: There are several third-party debugging tools available that can be used to debug compiled C# applications. 
These tools can be used to set breakpoints, step through the code, and inspect memory and variables.

Logging: Logging can be used to capture information about the application's behavior and identify the location of bugs or errors. 
You can use a logging framework such as log4net or NLog to log messages to a file or database
